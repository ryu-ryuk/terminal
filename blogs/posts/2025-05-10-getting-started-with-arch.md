# Getting Started with Arch Linux

My journey which led me to Linux began with a simple curiosity about operating systems. After trying Ubuntu and Fedora, I finally took the plunge into Arch Linux, and I've never looked back.

## Why Arch?

Arch Linux follows the KISS principle - "Keep It Simple, Stupid." But don't be fooled, simple doesn't mean easy. Arch is minimal by design, giving you complete control over your system.

Benefits include:
- Rolling release model
- Pacman package manager
- Extensive documentation (Arch Wiki)
- Complete customization
